<li> 01-dataClean.ipynb : an ipython notebook which contains a function to clean the data. It produces 02-vehicles-cleaned.csv </li>
<li> 02-dataSplit.ipynb: a notebook which splits the data into a training and testing set to prepare for EDA. It produces 03a-vehicles-sample.csv and 03b-vehicles-holdout.csv </li>
<li> 03a-EDA: a notebook which explores relationships and reccomends binning and transformations for the wrangling stage <li>
<li> 03b-vehicles-wrangling: a notebook which explains the rationale for certain transformations and binnings that are made to the datasets </li>
<li> functions.R: a repository of commonly called functions </li>
